# Bad Website

This project includes some of the worst code I can think of.

The question is, can you find all the problems?

There are 3 main areas to focus on:

1. [Security](./public/security/)
2. [Accessibility](./public/accessibility/)
3. [Performance](./public/performance/)

The order is not important, as a developer you really need to think about all 3.
