# HTML Injection

Or "Cross Site Scripting" (XSS).

On the login page, the form action uses PHP_SELF without quoting *or* HTML encoding the value.

We just need to get the admin to go to this page:

	/security/login.php/%22%3E%3Cscript%20src=%22/security/uploads/profile-pictures/666.js%22%3E%3C/script%3E%3Cf

Maybe via an email?

	Hi,

	I think there is something wrong with my account:

	https://example.com/security/login.php/%22%3E%3Cscript%20src=%22/security/uploads/profile-pictures/666.js%22%3E%3C/script%3E%3Cf

Try loading this yourself, and see what happens when you start typing in a password.

To fix...

You should encode all user supplied values on the page... this includes the requested page.

In PHP this is encoding is done with htmlentities().

This would have converted the "<" in the examples to "&lt;" so the script tags wouldn't have been read by the browser, but instead shown on the page in plain text.

Some templating systems like [Twig](https://twig.sensiolabs.org/) can sometimes help as well, but they still do not escape by default.

There are some additional things you can do incase you make a mistake (i.e. you miss one); these will be explained later :-)
