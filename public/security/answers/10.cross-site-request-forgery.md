# Cross Site Request Forgery

Get the admin to login (maybe they are constantly logged in), then view a page on the evil website.

But this evil website contained this tiny bit of HTML:

	<img src="https://example.com/security/logout.php" />

Probably not big a deal... the image is appears to be broken.

And annoyingly the admin is now logged out, where they might have been half way though filling out a big form.

---

But what happens if the evil website had included this little iframe:

	<iframe src="./iframe.php" width="1" height="1"></iframe>

And that iframe loaded this HTML:

	<form action="https://example.com/security/profile-edit.php?id=13" method="post" id="my-form">
		<input type="text" name="username value="changed" />
		<input type="text" name="password value="123" />
		<input type="text" name="picture_url value="/error.jpg" />
		<input type="submit" value="Go" />
	</form>

	<script type="text/javascript">
	//<![CDATA[
		var form = document.getElementById('my-form');
		if (form) {
			form.submit();
		}
	//]]>
	</script>

Did the evil website just tell the admin's browser to request some changes to an account?

What happens if this had created an account instead?

Or deleted some records?

To fix...

We create a random key, and set it in a cookie (lets call it `csrf-token`).

Then each time the browser requests a form on the website, the website returns the form with a hidden input with the value from that cookie.

And when the form is submitted, the value from the cookie should match the value submitted in the form (from the hidden input field).

This works because the evil website cannot know what the `csrf-token` value is (because they can't see the cookies), so they cannot create a form which contains a hidden input field with this value.

---

For extra bonus points, take the `csrf-token` and hash it with something unique to that form (maybe the form `action`), so if the evil hacker was able to find out what this value was (maybe they found a different form on your website that they got to submit to their server), then the token they receive is only useful to the form they exploited.

---

As to the logout link, I'd recommend creating a second `csrf-token` that is either stored in the $_SESSION variable, or if you are using a table of active sessions, put it in there.

Then each time you show a logout link, include this value in the query string, and check it when the user follows that link.

If it does not match, show them a new link (they might have had the previous page open for a few days).

This just means the 2 tokens are completely separate, and would be less damaging if they fell into the wrong hands (especially if the logout link is a standard link, where the value will appear in the query string, and can be found in the browsers history, or via the referrer header).
