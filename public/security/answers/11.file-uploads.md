# File uploads

This website allows the users to upload a profile image.

But what happens if the uploaded file is not an image.

You can see an example of this at:

To fix...

Apply as many restrictions as possible:

- Check that the file extension is correct.

- Check the uploaded mime-type is correct (be warned that Internet Explorer has it's own list of mime types, e.g. "image/x-png").

- If it's an image, check it's an image (e.g. in PHP you can do a rough check with `getimagesize()`).

- If it's an image, re-save it at an appropriate size - this ensures that it's actually an image, and avoids problems like a user uploading an image straight from their digital camera that's 5MB in size. In PHP you can use GD or ImageMagick (Imagick).

And when you upload the file, do not use the filename that the user provided.

Otherwise you could have 2 users trying to upload a file with the same name (which should be rejected, or even worse, override the original).

Or they might include non-standard characters, like "../../../etc/passwd", in an attempt to get it saved somewhere else on the server.
