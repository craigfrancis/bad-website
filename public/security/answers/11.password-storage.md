# Password storage

The password should **never** be stored in plain text.

You can tell because you can see it on the profile page.

Use a slow password hashing algorithm like bcrypt (an old one, but known to be good), scrypt (an improvement over bcrypt), Argon2 (a recent competition winner that might be a bit too new at the moment), or if you need to do so for compliance reasons PBKDF2 (also fairly old, and starting to show it's age).
