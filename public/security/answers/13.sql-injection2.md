# SQL Injection, part 2

What can you do with the profile edit page?

	$sql = 'UPDATE
			user
		SET
			username = "' . $_REQUEST['username'] . '",
			password = "' . $_REQUEST['password'] . '",
			picture_url = "' . $_REQUEST['picture_url'] . '"
		WHERE
			id = ' . $_REQUEST['id'];

Maybe this will be funny:
