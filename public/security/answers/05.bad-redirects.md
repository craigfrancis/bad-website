# Bad redirects

In PHP you can sent a Location header like this:

	header('Location: ./login.php');

And this header would be send to the browser, telling it to go to the `./login.php` URL.

But the script continues to run.

---

To exploit...

First logout from the website.

Then open your browsers developer tools, go to the Network tab, and request the URL:

	https://example.com/security/profile-edit.php?id=13

After you have changed the domain from **example.com** :-)

You should see a request for that URL, and it gives you a 302 response (i.e. the redirect).

All looks good.

Now look at the response.

If your browser didn't record one, try using the `curl` command in your terminal instead:

	curl -v https://example.com/security/profile-edit.php?id=13

Notice how it the response still includes the HTML form to edit the profile.

---

To fix...

Simply call `exit()` after sending the Location header.

---

Bonus problem...

Try to change the users profile image without logging in.

You can use the "-F" flag with `curl`.

And you need to specify the following fields:

- username
- password
- picture_url

Or if you want to cheat... use this:

	curl -v -F "username=changed" -F "password=123" -F "picture_url=/error.jpg" https://example.com/security/profile-edit.php?id=13

To check if it worked, look for a `Location` header going to `profile-edit-thank-you.php`, or look in the database :-)
