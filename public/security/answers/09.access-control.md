# Access control

If someone was to create an account with the username "craig" and the password "password".

And they logged in.

They would see their profile page, and be able to make changes to their profile.

But if they looked at the address bar, they would notice the URL:

	https://example.com/security/profile-edit.php?id=726

And they would see that they have been given the ID 726.

Could they change that in the address bar?

---

They could change the URL so that it's for the user ID 727.

	https://example.com/security/profile-edit.php?id=727

And they would be able to see and edit the profile for Amy.

---

To fix... check that everything the user requests, they have permission to see it.
